    <h3>
        A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans. Banks may also provide
        financial services such as wealth management, currency exchange, and safe deposit boxes. There are several
        different kinds of banks including retail banks, commercial or corporate banks, and investment banks.<br /><br />Banks are a very important
        part of the economy because they provide vital services for both consumers and businesses. As financial services providers, they give you a
        safe place to store your cash. Through a variety of account types such as checking and savings accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs),
        you can conduct routine banking transactions like deposits, withdrawals, check writing, and bill payments. You can also save your money
        and earn interest on your investment. The money stored in most bank accounts is federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
        (FDIC), up to a limit of $250,000 for individual depositors and $500,000 for jointly held deposits.
